"""
To find the
ï¿½
z value in Python for a given alpha (significance level) for both one-sided and two-sided tests using the standard normal distribution, you can use the scipy.stats module.

For a two-sided test, where you want to find the critical z-value for a given alpha level split equally between the tails of the distribution, you'd use norm.ppf from scipy.stats.

For a one-sided test, the z-value will differ depending on whether it's a left-tailed or right-tailed test. If it's a left-tailed test, you would use norm.ppf with alpha directly. For a right-tailed test, you'd subtract alpha from 1 and then use norm.ppf.
